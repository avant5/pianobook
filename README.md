# pianobook

This is the repository for all Avant 5 Pianobook submissions.  This repository includes the works-in-progress and some experimental versions of SFZ format pianos.  Final versions of these creations are available on the Pianobook site.

### The SFZ Files  

To use the SFZ files you need an SFZ player.  These particular creations are designed specifically to work with the Sforzando player and may not work correctly in all players that play SFZ instruments. The Sforzando player is free and runs on Mac and Windows.

### The Pianos

The SFZ files are merely instructions for the Sforzando player and do not include the sound files necessary to work.  The piano samples that need to accompany each of these SFZ instruments must be downloaded from the Pianobook website.  For each instrument a link to the proper Pianobook library page for that piano will be included, as well as any instructions for installation if special installation is needed. 

### Installation  

First download the matching piano instrument from Pianobook and unzip to your computer.  Then place the .sfz file from here in the **Instruments** folder of the Pianobook downloaded instrument.  Then use the *Import* feature in the Sforzando player, navigate to where your instrument is saved and load the .sfz file - and enjoy!

Thanks to Christian and everyone in the Pianobook community for making this possible.
