### WIP! ###
This is in the very early stages of a work-in-progress and not at all ready for distribution or submission to Pianobook.  

### Installation ###
Download the original Kontakt instrument from the Pianobook website.  Place this .sfz file into the root directory of the Kontakt instrument (in with the .nki file).

This version was built for and tested with the Sforzando player by Plogue, and not tested with other SFZ players.
